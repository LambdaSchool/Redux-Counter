// In this file you're going to work with some objects and arrays.
// Instead of mutating the data from within an object/array itself,
//   you're going to use immutable techniques.
// Be sure to **TEST** out your code in an editor/browser REPL of your choice;
//   Things like REPL.it, JSBin, and Quokka can all be used to test your code,
//   or just simply run `node immutable.js` in your terminal.

// Problem 1
//  Create an object called `person`.
//  It should have a name property, age and hometown.
//  Create a `newPerson` object from `person` using Object.assign.
//  Lets say that `newPerson` has the same hometown, but different name and age.
//  Be sure to console.log() both references to ensure that they are pointing to different objects.

const person = {
	name: 'jeffrey',
  age: 24,
  hometown: 'Galloway'
}

const newPerson = Object.assign({}, person, {name: 'patrick', age: 23});

console.log(person);
console.log(newPerson);

// Problem 2
//  Create an Array of 'superHeroes`.
//  Create a separate array of `superVillains`
//  Concatenate the two of them together using `.concat()`
//  Now, concatenate the two of them using the `...` spread operator

const superHeroes = ['batman', 'superman', 'flash'];
const superVillains = ['joker', 'penguin'];
const combinedSupers = [...superHeroes, ...superVillains];

console.log(superHeroes);
console.log(superVillains);
console.log(combinedSupers);

// Problem 3
//  Create an object `studentScores` with a 'name', 'age' and 'scores'
//  Where 'name' is a string, 'age' is a number and 'scores' is an array of numbers
//  The numbers for scores should be between 1 - 50.
//  Create a new object `studentAverage` using Object.assign() from the given original object.
//  The new object should filter out any scores that are less than 34.
//  Array.filter should be used here.

const studentScores = {
  name: 'jeffrey',
  age: 24,
  scores: [1, 25, 34, 35, 48]
};

const studentAverage = Object.assign(
  {}, 
  studentScores, 
  {scores: studentScores.scores.filter(score => {return score >= 34})});

console.log(studentScores);
console.log(studentAverage);
